I received my B.S. in Aerospace Engineering from Florida Institute
            of Technology in May 2022. I am currently a graduate student at
            Florida Tech studying Aerospace Engineering graduating in July 2023.
            While my primary interests are in the field of robotics and
            controls, I have involved myself in projects which allow me to work
            on different aspects of aerospace engineering such as rocket
            propulsion and heat transfer. With some colleagues, I continue to
            perform research into developing a solid propellant propulsion
            system for small satellites. I also find time (somehow) to mind
            boggle over concepts in computer and electrical engineering such as
            computer architecture and communication systems(mainly RF) along
            with whatever topic(s) I am interested in at the moment.
