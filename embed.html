      <h2>Low Level Programming of ATMega328p Microcontroller</h2>
      <p>
        The ATMega328p microcontroller is the brains of the famous arduino
        boards. The simplicity of using the Arduino IDE to program a board is a
        major contributor to its popularity. The built in functions allow one to
        program fairly complex projects with ease. Behind the scenes, these
        built in functions must interface directly with the microcontroller unit
        (MCU).
      </p>
      <h3>Microcontroller Architecture</h3>
      <p>
        THe distinction between a Microcontroller and a Microprocessor is subtle
        but important. A microprocessor contains the Arithmetic and Logic Unit
        (ALU), the control unit and required registers. A microcontroller
        contains a microprocessor plus the corresponding IO ports, RAM and ROM,
        counters and timers.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the first project in the graduate Mechatronics course that I took,
        we were tasked with making a time-accurate stopwatch using an arduino
        microcontroller board without the use of any Arduino IDE built in
        functions. Thus, it was required to directly interface with the
        registers on the ATMega328p.
      </p>
      <h3>Hardware</h3>
      <p>
        The hardware for this project is fairly simple and consists of an
        Arduino Nano and a 4-digit, 7-segment display. The 7-segment display
        requires a sequence of 1's and 0's corresponding to different segments
        which produce a different number on the display. The different numbers
        are shown in the figure below.
      </p>
      <img
        src="imgs/sevSegNums.png"
        alt="seven segment numbers"
        style="
          width: 450px;
          height: auto;
          display: block;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
        "
      />
      <p>
        Then, a so called 'truth table' can be derived which has a 1 or a 0 for
        each segment in order to produce the desired number shape. This truth
        table is shown below.
      </p>
      <img
        src="imgs/sevSegTruthTable.png"
        alt="seven segment numbers"
        style="
          width: 350px;
          height: auto;
          display: block;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
        "
      />
      <p>
        To control a 4 digit display, it seems at first glance that we require 7
        control lines for each digit. This would mean we need 28 individual
        control lines coming from the Arduino. This is simply not possible!
        Fortunately, the 4-digit, 7-segment display is configured in such a way
        that we can use only 7 control lines for determining the number and 4
        control lines for determining which digit is turned on. If we turn on
        each digit conseutively at a high enough frequency, a phenomenon known
        as persistence of vision tricks us into thinking the digits are all lit
        up at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        From above, we could use the 11 control lines for the 4 digit display.
        However, this only leaves 2 space digital IO ports on the Arduino. If
        the project required more IO ports for some other peripheral, we would
        be out of luck. So, for this project, I decided to make use of two 8-bit
        shift registers in order to reduce the number of IO ports used on the
        Arduino for controlling the 4 digit display. The shift registers store
        binary values within their D flip-flop internal logic circuitry. For
        this application, the shift register is acting as a serial to parallel
        convertor.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this project, the 74HC595 Shift Register was utilized. The figure
        below shows the pins and their description. To utilize this chip as a
        serial to parallel convertor, only 3 connections to the arduino are
        required: Serial data, clock and latch.
      </p>
      <img
        src="imgs/shiftReg.jpg"
        alt="seven segment numbers"
        style="
          width: 550px;
          height: auto;
          display: block;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
        "
      />
      <p>
        Along with the two shift registers and the display, a button was
        required in order to stop and start the stopwatch. For the cheap button
        used in this project, mechanical bouncing was a large issue. Bouncing
        occurs because the mechanical contacts of the button can vibrate and
        bounce. This potentially leads to multiple 'pushes' of the button when
        it was only intended to be pushed once. Sometimes, software can be used
        to debounce the button. I decided to use a hardware debouncing circuit
        inspired by one of my favorite youtuber's videos on debouncing,
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81BgFhm2vz8">Ben Eater</a>. The
        circuit utilizes the famous 555 chip with a resistor and capacitor on
        the inputs of the 555's comparators. Simply put, when the button is
        connected through the 555 debouncing circuit, only a single pulse will
        be input into the arduino regardless of any bouncing from the mechanical
        contacts of the button. I highly recommend watching the Ben Eater video
        linked above for more details!
      </p>
      <p>
        THe figure below shows the final wiring of the stopwatch consisting of
        an arduino nano, two 74HC595 shift registers, a 555 timer, button and
        4-digit, 7-segment display. The wiring was done on a breadboard and I
        made it nice and neat which took more time than I expected.

      />
      <h3>Software</h3>
      <p>
        After the hardware is wired and connected, the software is needed to
        produce a time-accurate stopwatch. The primary softare mechanism
        utilized is an interrupt. When the interrupt is triggered, a subroutine
        can be run, known as an Interrupt SubRoutine (ISR). In this case, a
        hardware timer on the MCU is setup which triggers an interrupt at the
        desired frequency. For this project, that desired frequency is 100 Hz so
        that the time keeps track of the time to the hundreths place after the
        decimal.
      </p>
      <p>
        The code snippet below shows how to setup the 16-bit timer on the
        ATMega328p. The prescaler is required in order to reduce the number of
        clock ticks that we use since the timer is based on the pulses of the
        clock.
      </p>
      <pre><code class = "language-c++">
void setup() 
{

    // stop interrupts
    cli();                  
    
    // Reset the control register
    // Reset entire TCCR1A to 0
    //Reset entire TCCR1B to 0
    TCCR1A = 0;                 
    TCCR1B = 0;               

    //Set CS12 to 1 to use prescalar of 256
    TCCR1B |= 0b00000100;                          

    // Set OCIE1A to 1 to enable compare match A register
    TIMSK1 |= 0b00000010;                          

    // frequency of timer in Hz
    timerFreq = 100;                               

    //set compare register A to proper value based on timer frequency and prescaler
    OCR1A = (16e6 / (256 * timerFreq)) + 1;        

    //setup latchPin, dataPin, clockPin as output in Data Direction Register for Port B (DDRB)
    DDRB = DDRB | 0b00011010;

    // setup button pin as input
    DDRD = DDRD & 0b11111101;

    // Setup interrupt button
    //Enable Pin change interrupt for port D
    PCICR |= 0b00000100;

    // using pin D2 as interrupt pin
    PCMSK2 |= 0b00000100;

    // Initialize variables
    timeCount = 0;
    start = false;
    disp = false;

    sei(); 
    // display all zeros on startup
    displayAll(zero, zero, zero, zero);

}  
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        When the timer reaches the value set in the output compare register,
        OCR1A, an interrupt will be triggered. In code, this runs the ISR
        associated with the timer1_compa_vect. The entire stopwatch operates
        soley on interrupts. Thus, the loop() function contains no code. Each
        time the timer triggers the interrupt, 1/100 of a second has passed.
        Then, the code in the ISR will update the value written on the 4-digit
        display. The code snippet below shows how this is implemented including
        the ISR for the button which can be used to start and stop the
        stopwatch.
      </p>
      <pre><code class = "language-c++">
void loop() {

}

ISR(PCINT2_vect)
{
  if (PIND >> 2 & 0b00000100 >> 2)
  {
    disp = !disp;
    start = true;
  }
}


ISR(TIMER1_COMPA_vect)
{
  // reset timer
  TCNT1  = 0;

  if (disp && start)
  {
    timeCount += 1;
    displayTime(timeCount);

  }
  else
  {
    displayTime(timeCount);
  }
}
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        In this code above, the variable timeCount keeps track of how many
        hundreths of a second have elapsed and that value is passed to the
        displayTime() function. This function determines which value to write
        for which digit and then which sequence of 1's and 0's is required for
        drawing that digit. This function is shown below. The sequence()
        function takes in a digit between 0 and 9 and determines the sequence of
        1's and 0's that need to be sent to the shift registers and then the
        4-digit 7-segment display. The shiftOutSam() function sends the sequence
        of 1's and 0's out on the serial data port.

      <p>
        The displayTime() function takes in the timeCount variable containing
        the number of hundreths of seconds to display, determines the sequence
        of 1's and 0's for each digit and sends the data out on the serial data
        port. As mentioned above, this stopwatch display utilizes the
        persistence of vision phenomenon that we experience. It seems like the
        digits are updated at the same exact time but this is not possible with
        the hardware setup that I chose. Instead, the values are updated
        conseutively at a high enough frequency that it seems like they are all
        updated at the same time. This is prevelant in the displayTime()
        function as there is a slight delay() after each shiftOut of the data.

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        In this project, I learned about the timer and compare registers on the
        ATMega328p microcontroller and how to program them by directly setting
        the bits in the register. Check out the other projects in this category
        for how to use the ADC registers, how to make a PWM signal for a servo
        motor and more!
