        <p>I received my B.S. in Aerospace Engineering from Florida Institute of Technology in 2022. I am currently a graduate student
        at Florida Tech studying Aerospace Engineering on track to graduate in July 2023. While my primary interests are in the field of robotics and controls, 
        I have involved myself in projects which allow me to work on different aspects of aerospace engineering such as rocket propulsion and heat transfer. 
        With some colleagues, I continue to perform research into developing a solid propellant propulsion system for small satellites.
