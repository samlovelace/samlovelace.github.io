          I received my B.S. in Aerospace Engineering from Florida Institute of
          Technology in May 2022. I am currently a graduate student at Florida
          Tech studying Aerospace Engineering graduating in July 2023. While my
          primary interests are in the field of robotics and controls, I have
          involved myself in projects which allow me to work on different
          aspects of aerospace engineering such as rocket propulsion and heat
          transfer. With some colleagues, I continue to perform research into
          developing a solid propellant propulsion system for small satellites.
          I also find time (somehow) to mind boggle over concepts in computer
          and electrical engineering such as computer architecture and
          communication systems(mainly RF) along with whatever topic(s) I am
          interested in at the moment.
